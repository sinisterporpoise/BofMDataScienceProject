# BofMDataScienceProject
A collection of files and a Jupyter Notebook for a simple data science project on the Book of Mormon

The preliminary part of this program has been doing the data cleaning of the 1830s Book of Mormon text, and generating the CSV files necessary for analysis.  The intent is to use the K Nereest Neighbor Alorithm to see if all the Books of Mormon more than likely have the same author or a different author.  This could serve as a starting point for people who want to do more robust research later.
